#  Tech War Project  
### E-Commerce Logistics & Delivery Data Analysis

##  About the Project
The **Tech War Project** is a data analysis project focused on understanding **E-commerce logistics and delivery performance**.  
Using real-world delivery data, this project explores order trends, delivery efficiency, customer satisfaction, and regional performance through **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization**.

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end data analysis workflow** using Python.

##  Project Objectives
- Analyze delivery performance across regions and partners  
- Handle missing and inconsistent data  
- Study the impact of delivery time on customer ratings  
- Identify year-wise revenue trends  
- Visualize delivery status and order value distributions  

##  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization  
- **Seaborn** – statistical visualizations  

## Dataset Information
**Dataset Type:** E-commerce logistics & delivery data  

### Key Columns:
- Order Value  
- Delivery Time (Days)  
- Delivery Status  
- Shipping Mode  
- Region & City  
- Delivery Partner  
- Customer Rating  
- Order Date  

##  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Checked dataset shape and data types  
- Identified missing values using heatmaps  
- Filled numerical missing values using **median**  
- Filled categorical missing values using **mode** or `"Unknown"`  
- Converted `Order_Date` to datetime format  
- Extracted **Year** for time-based analysis  

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Analysis Performed:
- Missing value analysis  
- Average delivery time by shipping mode  
- Order value by delivery status  
- Delivery partner performance comparison  
- Customer rating vs delivery time relationship  
- Year-wise revenue trends (2021–2024)  

### Visualizations Used:
- Bar charts  
- Box plots  
- Pie charts  
- Line plots  
- Heatmaps  
- Correlation matrix  

## Year-Wise Analysis
- Revenue and order trends analyzed for:
  - 2021  
  - 2022  
  - 2023  
  - 2024  
- Delivery status contribution visualized for each year  
- Performance changes observed across time  

## Key Insights
- Faster deliveries generally lead to better customer ratings  
- Some delivery partners consistently perform better  
- Revenue and order values vary significantly by year  
- Shipping mode impacts delivery time  
- Proper missing value handling improves analysis accuracy
